		<synopsis>Bible-Believers often self-inflict with a sense that "science" has a monopoly on truth and has "proven" the Bible not only ignorant on science fact, but actually in error when speaking on it. Not so. It is said, "The Bible is not a science book." That may be so. It is a book of mostly history and theology. But where it does speak of science, it has proven not only to be broadly reliable, but in fact hundreds or thousands of years ahead of man's own limited knowledge of his universe. This lively audio-augmented powerpoint lecture vividly brings home the point of biblical authority and factuality. It also fully demonstrates the totally hypothetical and perpetually tentative nature of what mankind falsely has called "science." Be encouraged in both science and the faith, through this message. They are one in the same, whether anybody is willing to admit it or not. We'd might as well admit it.</synopsis>
