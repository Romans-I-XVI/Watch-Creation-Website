		<synopsis>Atheists have inaugurated their first public monument, outside the courthouse in Starke, FL (next to a monument of the Ten Commandments). Paul and Eric discuss this, and show items from a contemporary news broadcast. They show how the quotes that the atheists use are illogical and out of context. They contrast the atheist event with the mission of Creation Today, and explain how people can partner with us in our Gospel-centered, faith-building ministry.</synopsis>

                <synopsis>Two hundred years ago, scientists began discovering and digging up fossilized bones of large extinct creatures. In this week’s Creation Today Show, Paul and Eric show that these creatures were, quite correctly, labeled as dragons, even in scientific literature, and even after the word dinosaur had been coined. As Paul and Eric discuss the history of the discovery of dinosaur fossils, we see that God’s Word accurately records references to such creatures, because God made them along with the other animals in the beginning!</synopsis>

                <synopsis>We have lots of evidence that man and dinosaurs have always lived together. In this week’s Creation Today Show, Paul and Eric take the Bible, and use it as their foundation to interpret the dinosaur evidence. They also look at how evolutionary presuppositions are seen in media portrayals of dinosaurs and show how language and imagination constitute the only “evidence” that evolutionists have to offer.</synopsis>

Parasitic behavior would not have existed in the world that God designed, before Adam’s sin, and therefore these behaviors must have developed from ‘legitimate’ behaviors created by God.</synopsis>

                <synopsis>After decreasing popularity for many years, the Gap Theory is once again gaining momentum among churches. It teaches that a long period of time elapsed between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2, during which Satan fell, pre-Adamic humanoids roamed the Earth, and in which God sent an early flood to start the re-creation of the world in six literal days. Eric and Paul show from scripture that the Gap Theory is not possible and not biblical, maintaining that the plain reading of Scripture – a single week of God’s creative action – is the correct way to understand Genesis 1.</synopsis>

In this episode, Eric and Paul deconstruct an article on star formation using the ‘fuzzy words analysis’ method. After removing what the author believes is taking place, there is little real science remaining. Watch how easy it is for you to uncover the faith-based statements masquerading as science in this week’s episode of Creation Today.</synopsis>

                <synopsis>Bill Nye has become the “evangelism” guy – at least in terms of proselytizing for atheism. Paul and Eric report on their visit to a presentation by Bill Nye at the University of Florida at Gainsville. Nye’s atheism has nothing of substance to offer the young people, who, nevertheless, lined for a quarter of a mile to get to see their hero. Paul and Eric and a team of helpers had a thousand copies of Ray Comfort’s film “Evolution vs God” to give out. Nye’s worldview, however, is so bankrupt that he claimed that photos of Pluto would “change the world”.</synopsis>

Eric and Paul answer questions about the nature of this information, and how it could not possibly have evolved. They also look at an extraordinary new pseudo-scientific study that claims that humans might be partially evolved from pigs!</synopsis>
