        <synopsis>Evolutionists claim that evolution is "science" and creation is "religion." Eric Hovind presents a case to show that evolution has nothing to do with science—that's right, both creation and evolution are religions.</synopsis>

        <synopsis>Do we really know that the earth is ancient? Have we heard the evidence from the other side? The truth is that the evidence points strongly to a young earth. In fact, even dinosaurs fit into this worldview. God has given us limiting factors observable by science that point to a young earth, and confirm the account given in Scripture of a young creation and of a global flood about 4,400 years ago.</synopsis>

        <synopsis>Did man really live to be hundreds of years old before the Flood, as the Bible says? Could there be a scientific and biblical explanation for dinosaurs and giant men? Why do we see suffering in the world if a good God created it? Creationism accounts for all of this with the Biblical account of Adam's Fall and Noah's Flood.</synopsis>

        <synopsis>Evidence for dinosaurs in modern history is abundant. Historical records substantiate the theory that dinosaurs lived with man. There is even reference to them in the Bible! The truth is, God created all living animals, and He told Noah to take them on the ark. Therefore, we should find much evidence that they lived with man - and we do!</synopsis>

        <synopsis>Perspective determines everything. Facts are absolute, but interpretation changes with the individual. Evolutionists are always trying to blur the line between the facts and their interpretations of the facts. They assert that their theories are fact rather than faith. In reality, the facts support the Biblical account of Creationism. Both Evolutionism and Creationism are faiths. They are perspectives. While the claims of Creationists are repeatedly being vindicated by science, Evolutionists base their entire faith upon lies, error, and deception.</synopsis>

        <synopsis>Some things are self-evidently true. They are axiomatic. You cannot have a painting without a painter, and you cannot have a creation without a Creator. Atheistic Evolutionists have to deny logic itself in order to argue against such obvious truth. Furthermore, they are approaching the truth from the wrong perspective, thus limiting their accuracy.</synopsis>
